- This is a repo that determines all the system configuration. For example if you are wanting to modify the system configuration for neovim, go ahead and look in "~/limonene/home/common/nvim.nix" not "~/.config/nvim". Simlarly window management is in "~/limonene/home/wm/sway.nix".
- This also handles configurations for macos and linux simultaneously the folder "home/common" is for utilities that exist in both mac and linux, and thd folder "home/linux" is for linux specific packages.
